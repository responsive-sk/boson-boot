# Detailed Implementation Plan

## Current Status
- **Architecture:** Modern Kernel-based with PSR-15 middleware support
- **Package Manager:** pnpm (primary), npm (fallback)
- **PHP Version:** 8.4+
- **Server:** `php -S localhost:8080 -t public` or `composer serve`
- **Demo URL:** http://localhost:8080

### Completed Features

## Development Workflow

### **Theme Development**
```bash
# Install dependencies for specific theme
cd templates/assets/[theme] && pnpm install

# Development with hot reload
cd templates/assets/[theme] && pnpm run dev

# Build for production
cd templates/assets/[theme] && pnpm run build
```

### **Database Operations**
```bash
# Setup database and seed data
./bin/migrate

# Cache cleanup
./bin/cache-cleanup
```

### **Testing**
```bash
# Run all tests
composer test:all

# Static analysis
composer analyse

# Code style
composer cs:fix
```

### **Production Deployment**
```bash
# Build themes
cd templates/assets/tailwind && pnpm run build

# Set production environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with production settings

# Run migrations
./bin/migrate
```

## Component Conversion Plan

### **Hero Section: Lit â†’ HTMX**

**Original Lit (complex):**
```javascript
// hero-section.js - 200+ lines
class HeroSection extends LitElement {
  render() {
    return html`<section>...</section>`;
  }
}
```

**New HTMX (simple):**
```php
<!-- templates/components/hero-section.php -->
<section class="hero-container">
  <div class="hero-content">
    <h1><?= $title ?></h1>
    <p><?= $description ?></p>
    <a href="<?= $buttonUrl ?>" class="btn"><?= $buttonText ?></a>
  </div>
</section>
```

### **Benefits of HTMX Approach:**
- **Server-side rendering** - Better SEO
- **No JavaScript bundle** - Faster loading
- **Progressive enhancement** - Works without JS
- **Simpler debugging** - Standard HTML/PHP
- **Better accessibility** - Native HTML semantics

## Commands Reference

```bash
# Development server
php -S localhost:8080 -t public

# Install dependencies
composer install

# Check server status
curl -I http://localhost:8080

# Kill server (if needed)
kill 8

# Database operations
sqlite3 data/blog.sqlite < data/schema.sql
sqlite3 data/blog.sqlite "SELECT * FROM posts;"
```

## Success Criteria

**Phase 1 Complete When:**
1. Homepage loads with hero section
2. Blog posts display from SQLite
3. HTMX lazy loading works
4. No JavaScript errors
5. Responsive design works

**Final Goal:**
- Full feature parity with Lit version
- Better performance (SSR)
- Simpler codebase
- Pragmatic DDD architecture

---

**Status:** Production-ready application with modern architecture and comprehensive documentation
